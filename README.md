# Air Pollution Inequality GeoHub by Error-999999

The Air Pollution Inequality GeoHub is an informative and robust application that highlights air pollution in neighbourhoods across Canada which suffer from inequality. The goal of this application is to identify hotspots for environmental racism and other environmental inequities that require priority attention. We hope to spread awareness and make a change.

## Mission Statement 
In Canada, chronic exposure to various airborne substances contributes tremendously to premature deaths and numerous respiratory diseases and disabilities. In 2015, urban air pollution accounted for 7,712 deaths in Canada. Another study found strikingly high rates of acute myeloid leukemia linked to elevated levels of air pollution in Sarnia and Hamilton, both above the national average. Despite air pollution being a nation-wide problem, certain socioeconomic demographics are at greater health risks than others.

A 2018 analysis found that health inequalities exist on various socioeconomic statuses including income and employment, and that certain groups such as Indigenous peoples, immigrants, and racial minorities, had worse health outcomes than the general population. More than one million low-income Canadians live within one kilometer of a major source of industrial air pollution. Approximately 20.8% of racialized people are of low-income households compared to 12.2% of non-racialized people. A 2015 study of North America found that lower-socioeconomic status communities are exposed to higher concentrations of air pollutants. A 2008 mapping of 17 neighborhoods in Toronto showed a high correlation between air pollutants and poverty rates. In 2001, a study in Montreal found that higher air pollution was positively associated with higher unemployment rates and individuals with less than high school education. Interpolated surfaces in Hamilton showed a twofold increase in air pollution concentration amongst populations with lower socioeconomic status throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s. These groups are victims of environmental inequality that has persisted in Canada since colonial rule, leading to severe health implications and unjust living conditions for those impacted.

The Air Pollution Inequality GeoHub aims to function as an informative and robust application to support the identification of air pollution hotspots and vulnerable communities most affected by it. The major sources of air pollution identified in this application are industrial facilities as well as motor vehicles. The demographic groups and characteristics analyzed include people of colour, indigenous people, low income groups, and unemployment rate. The purpose is to aggregate and display information and geospatial data that reveals the disproportionate relationship of air quality on various demographic groups by location. 

## GeoHub Description and Pages

### Home
The home page is designed to provide information about how air quality and health is measured and calculated in Canada, as well as links to 3rd party real time applications which measure air quality based on particulate matter. It introduces areas of high air pollution and then vulnurable and at-risk groups that experience environmental inequality across Canada. The banner along the bottom of the geohub contains links to other pages. 

### About Vulnurable Groups
Page 2 is a deeper dive into the demographic groups analyzed. It explains why these specific groups and socioeconomic variables were chosen and how they have influenced environmental inequality in Canada over decades. All of the work on this page references scholaraly articles published across Canada. 

### BIPOC WebApp
Page 3 is the BIPOC WebApp. It hosts two applications, one dedicated to facility air pollution and the second to motor vehicle air emissions. Both applications reference the introductory "Using the Web Apps" section, which better explains how the applications can be used to identify inequalities related to race and ethnicity. You may be amazed by what you find! 

### Income and Employment WebApp
Page 4 is the Income and Employment WebApp. It hosts two applications, one dedicated to facility air pollution and the second to motor vehicle air emissions. Both applications reference the introductory "Using the Web Apps" section, which better explains how the applications can be used to identify inequalities relaed to income and employment. You may be amazed by what you find! 

### Geographic and Demographic Data
Page 5 is an overview of the data used to investigate the geographic and demographic relationship to air pollution. It is divided into 'Air Pollution Data' and 'Demographic Data', with links to sources and additional information embedded. The geohub focuses on select air pollutants released from heavy polluting sectors. The data was retrieved from the National Pollutant Release Inventory and Statistics Canada. The demographic data used to highlight environmental inequality across canada focuses on two groups and two socioeconomic factors: 

1. Visible Minorities 
2. Aboriginal Peoples 
3. Income 
4. Unemployment Rate

This data was retrieved from the 2016 Canadian census.
